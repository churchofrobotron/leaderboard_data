# Overview

This is the data for the [Church of Robotron](https://churchofrobotron.com/) leaderboard. It is used for the [leaderboard](https://churchofrobotron.com/leaderboard/index.html) and [faces of futility](https://churchofrobotron.com/leaderboard/faces.html). 

It is kept separate from the [main repo](https://github.com/churchofrobotron/mcor) to keep that repo size down.  

# Leaderboard file info

Each score is saved into the `data/` directory with a file name in this format:

```
[initials]_[score]_[datetime]_[location].gif
```

This collection of files is the "database" of scores for the church.  

Then the `gen_score_db.js` script is run to generate JSON files that the website can use to display the leaderboard.

# Wise words
